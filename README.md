ical-relay
==========
Relay ical urls and edit them on the fly with different modules.

# Usage

You can download an example configuration file from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JM-Lemmi/ical-relay/master/config.yml.example).

The edited ical can be accessed on `http://server/profiles/profilename`

For persistent configuration changes you will need a postgress database. See [Config](#config) for more information.

## Install from Apt Repository

If you're running a Debian based system, you can install the latest release from the my Package Repository.

This allows automatic updates to the latest version with `apt upgrade`.

```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://pkg.julian-lemmerich.de/deb stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jm-lemmi.list
curl http://pkg.julian-lemmerich.de/deb/gpg.key | apt-key add -
apt update
apt install ical-relay
```

If you want to run the beta version, you can use the `testing` repository. Replace `stable` with `testing` in the above commands.

This installs the ical-relay as a systemd service. Change the configuration in `/etc/ical-relay/config.yml` and start the service with `systemctl start ical-relay`.

## Install Package from Github

Download the package from the latest release.

Install with your package manager:

```
apt install ./ical-relay_1.3.0_amd64.deb
```

This will create a systemd service called `ical-relay.service` which can be started with `systemctl start ical-relay.service`. The default configuration file is located at `/etc/ical-relay/config.yml`.

Run a notifier manually:

```
/usr/bin/ical-relay --notifier <name> --config config.yml
```

## Docker

Docker images are availible in arm and x64 variants.

The default health check only works, when ical-relay is listening on port 80 (inside the container)

# Config

`config.yml` contains all the general server configuration for the HTTP server. You can change the loglevel to "debug" to get more information.

```yaml
version: 4
server:
  addr: ":80"
  loglevel: "info"
  url: "https://cal.julian-lemmerich.de"
  litemode: false
  disable-frontend: false
  templatepath: /opt/ical-relay/templates
  faviconpath: /static/media/favicon.svg
  name: "Calendar"
  imprintlink: "https://your-imprint"
  privacypolicylink: "http://your-data-privacy-policy"
  db:
    host: postgres
    db-name: ical_relay
    user: dbuser
    password: password
  mail:
    smtp_server: "mailout.julian-lemmerich.de"
    smtp_port: 25
    sender: "calnotification@julian-lemmerich.de"
  super-tokens:
    - rA4nhdhmr34lL6x6bLyGoJSHE9o9cA2BwjsMOeqV5SEzm61apcRRzWybtGVjLKiB
```

Profile Data is stored in `data.yml` or in a database:

```
profiles:
  relay:
    source: "https://example.com/calendar.ics"
    public: true
    immutable-past: true
    admin-tokens:
      - eAn97Sa0BKHKk02O12lNsa1O5wXmqXAKrBYxRcTNsvZoU9tU4OVS6FH7EP4yFbEt
    rules:
      - filters:
          - type: "regex"
            regex: "testentry"
            target: "summary"
          - type: "timeframe"
            from: "2021-12-02T00:00:00Z"
            until: "2021-12-31T00:00:00Z"
        action:
          type: "delete"
        expires: "2022-12-31T00:00:00Z"

notifiers:
  relay:
    source: "http://localhost/relay"
    interval: "15m"
    admin-token: eAn97Sa0BKHKk02O12lNsa1O5wXmqXAKrBYxRcTNsvZoU9tU4OVS6FH7EP4yFbEt
    recipients:
      - "jm.lemmerich@gmail.com"
```

You can list as many profiles as you want. Each profile has to have a source.
You can then add as many rules as you want. The `name:` filed specifies the module, the rule references. All other fields are dependent on the module.
The rule are executed in the order they are listed. You can create multiple rules from one module.

To import data into a DB when running full mode, use the `--import-data` flag.

### config.yml versioning

| ical-relay version | config version |
|--------------------|----------------|
| 2.0.0-beta.5       | 2              |

| 2.0.0-beta.9       | 4 !            |

## data.yml versioning

| ical-relay version | data version   |

### database versioning

| ical-relay version | db version |
|--------------------|------------|

## Lite-Mode

Running in Lite-Mode disables the frontend and api and doesnt need a database. It reads the profiles and rules from the `data.yaml`.

You can use litemode either with the --lite-mode flag or with the config option "lite-mode: true".
By default ical-relay will start in full mode.

Immutable-Past Files are still written to file in lite mode.

## immutable-past

Add `immutable-past: true` in the profile to enable it.

If you enable immutable past, the relay will save all events that have already happened in a file called `<profile>-past.ics` in the storage path. Next time the profile is called, the past events will be added to the ical.

## Rules

A Rule contains one or more filters and one action. The filters determine which events will be edited. The action then determines, what changes for the events.

Feel free do open a PR with filters and actions of your own.

Adding `expires: <RFC3339>` to any rule will remove it on the next cleanup cycle after the date has passed. Currently the Cleanup runs every 1h.

### Filters

Currently the Filters can not handle Repeating Events. See Issue #77

#### regex

* `regex`: The regex to match against
* `target`: Parameter to match against the regex. Default Summary, options: Summary, Description, Location

#### id

* `id`: Event ID.

This can match multiple events, for example with repeating events.

#### timeframe

* `after`, `before`. At least one is mandatory. Uses max time, if none is given. Can also be set to "now".

#### duplicates

No parameters. Filters the second and following events that are identified as duplicate. Looks at start, end, summary. If all three are equal, the Event is deemed duplicate.

#### all

No parameters. Filters all.

#### duration

* `duration` in timeDuration format (most relevant: `m`, `h`)Â´
* `operator`. Either "longer" or "shorter", default "longer".

### Actions

#### delete

No parameters. Deletes the Filtered Events.

#### edit

* `new-summary`, optional: the new summary
* `new-description`, optional: the new description
* `new-start`, optional: the new start time in RFC3339 format "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"
* `new-end`, optional: the new end time in RFC3339 format "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"
* `new-location`, optional: the new location
* `overwrite`, default true: Possible values are 'true', 'false' and 'fillempty'. True: Overwrite the property if it already exists; False: Append, Fillempty: Only fills empty properties.  Does not apply to 'new-start' and 'new-end'.
* `move-time`, optional, not together with 'new-start' or 'new-end': add time to the whole entry, to move entry. uses Go ParseDuration: most useful units are "m", "h"
  * when the original time does not have a timezone, sets the timezone to UTC, so it needs to be adjusted for that.

#### add-reminder

* `time`: time in timeDuration Format the alarm will go off before the event.

This usually doesnt work when used in server mode. Most Calendar Applications ignore reminders of external calendars.

#### strip-info

* `mode`: "availibility" (puts busy status as summary, and removes all other information), or "limited" (only keeps summary and busy status)

Inspired by Outlooks export options.

# API

For details about the API endpoints, see the swagger documentation at [./documentation/swagger.yml](./documentation/swagger.yml)

Autorization is done in three levels:

- Public: No token, can use all public endpoints.
- Profile-Admin: Token for a specific profile, can use most endpoints for this profile, but not all module types.
- Super-Admin: Rights for all profiles and can also use all modules. May include LFI or CSRF-capable config options. Should be used with caution.

### Combining multiple calendar Profiles into one ICS

http://localhost:8080/profiles-combi/profile1+profile2

### Adding an Event from File via API:

```
curl -F eventfile=@./testfile.ics -H "Authorization: <token>" http://localhost/api/profiles/test/newentryfile
```

# Notifier

The notifiers do not have to reference a local ical, you can also use this to only call external icals.

You can configure SMTP with authentication or without to use an external mailserver, or something local like boky/postfix.

If you start the calendar with the `--notifier` flag, it will start the notifier from config. This allows setting up cronjobs to run the notifier.

# Development

I am happy for PRs of any features, like new Actions, Filters or Bug Fixes.

See some more information for development at [development.md](./development.md)

# Support

This Project was developed for my own use, and I do not offer support for this at all.

If you do want to use it and need help I will try my best to help, but I can't promise anyting. You can contact me here: help@julian-lemmerich.de
